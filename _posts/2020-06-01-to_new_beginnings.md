 Having entered a new decade, I can’t help but look back at the decade gone by and wonder if there’s ever been such a game-changing ten-year run for HR professionals – what with HR automation, people analytics, gig economy, millennials and learning-on-the-go challenging every paradigm of people management for the better. HR is moving from processing paper to making individuals feel valued in the organisation and supporting their talent journeys

 These are exciting times to be working on people capability. Not only are the employees more aware about the possibilities and opportunities that exist to enable them, their managers are more receptive than ever. This has largely to do with the fact that learning or talent development has become more embedded into the employee’s role, rather than a stand-alone training program with little transferability into the learner’s job.

What is all the more exciting about building people capability in these times is the ecosystem we are working in – the community that wants to learn and become better than yesterday. Our peers who share knowledge and new learning as freely as they share their Instagram updates. The manager who spend their after-work hours learning a new tech-tool from a college grad. The HR management systems that are making way for Employee Experience Platforms.

Industrial Revolution 4.0 has indeed come knocking at our doors in style! I can’t wait to see how this unfolds in the 2020s and the endless possibilities it brings for us to leverage.
