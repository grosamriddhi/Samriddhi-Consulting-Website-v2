There's an endless amount of advise on product-market fit - a large number of models and an even larger set of metrics. Founders, Product Managers and Marketers often struggle with a number of these variables - often so distracting that you forget how you got started on this road.

We've been down this road many times, 16 times to be precise so far. By no means does that make us perfect at the process, but our experience often helps our customers though the journey.

Did you notice that we used the word journey? One thing that most theorists agree is that the product-market fit is not static - it changes because we change, our environment changes and our customers change.

We at Samriddhi have built a broad model around this process. We've applied this to Fast Moving Consumer Goods, the Apparel Value Chain, Financial Services and Healthcare Industries. The model has evolved along the journey and will continue to evolve. If you'd like to learn more, please share your co-ordinates.
