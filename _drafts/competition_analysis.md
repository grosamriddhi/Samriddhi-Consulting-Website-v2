Over the course of our business journey, we've discovered a rather unique take on Competition Analysis. Rather than study product features of competing products, we delve deep into the customer's mind to understand how they are looking to solve their problem.

This discovery process takes us on a roller coaster ride which helps us understand complex purchase behaviors of customers and how they think of problems, solutions and value.

Through this journey, we have found many surprises. Some anecdotes:
- products that we thought of as competition are integral to solving the customer's problem
- we've discovered that we were hugely underestimating what the product meant to the customer and thus we had been leaving a ton of money on the table

We've applied this to Fast Moving Consumer Goods, the Apparel Value Chain and Healthcare Industries. If you'd like to learn more, please share your co-ordinates.
