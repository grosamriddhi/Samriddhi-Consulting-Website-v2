However, of the five key trends highlighted by the study, the one that really stood out for me personally was that “managers feel wedged between leadership and employee expectations.” A cynic friend laughed when I mentioned this to her – when have managers not felt sandwiched! Alright, so this may not be a new trend but maybe this statistic calls for us to sit up and take notice of the magnitude of the problem – a whopping 54% of managers responded in the study that they felt leadership was out of touch with the employees. What a transition from just a few months ago when Friday coffee chats and virtual town-halls became a go-to guide for leaders to connect with the employees closely. In fact, the leaders were so cued into the frontline challenges and reached out to all employees so often, that the very role of middle-level managers started to get questioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what has changed between the summer of 2021 and the spring of 2022? Indeed, the Great Resignation comes to mind. Also, with two years completed in this new normal, leaders are now keen to bring the focus back to the bottom line and productivity. Employees, on the other hand, have moved on by prioritising their mental health and wellness. In the midst of this, managers could feel stuck trying to balance business results with employee expectations. However, seen differently, it’s a huge opportunity for managers to cement their roles within organisations, as coaches and champions of sustainable engagement. The role of mid-level managers is open to massive disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Janus – the mythical Roman god of doors and gateways depicted with two opposing faces – the middle-level manager of today has to empathise with both the leadership and the employee in order to unlock opportunities. For those of us walking this critical tight-rope, here are some of the ways that can help us navigate the sticky mid-level sandwich better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-be-the-champion-coach&quot;&gt;1. Be the champion coach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no more shying away from coaching for managers. I have come across managers who have been great at delivering results and understand their functional expertise perfectly. However, coaching is not about creating clones of oneself, right? It is not about ‘teaching’ someone how to make the perfect sales pitch, for example. It is about helping your team members explore and identify the ‘right’ sales pitch – what works best for them to get results. This calls for deep empathy, simplifying the process of learning, and listening. When managers become coaches, they often share stories of their journey. Storytelling is a great coaching tool, but don’t forget to listen more than you share as a coach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-be-a-key-cultural-anchor&quot;&gt;2. Be a key cultural anchor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that building a strong, single culture is the most important contribution of the managerial layer. As an organisation grows, the leadership gets removed from the front-line employees. In order that the vision of the founders is not diluted by the time it reaches the last mile, the managerial cadre upholds and lives the cultural tenets. Great managers ensure that sub-cultures do not crop up. Every team meeting, every communication, and every process embeds the unspoken organisational culture – and it is the managers who are the custodians of these elements. This role becomes more pronounced in a remote/ hybrid work environment. If an employee feels a disconnect in the spoken and written word versus what they experience in their day-to-day operations, their reasons to move on just add up. Modern managers play a key role in holding together their teams towards a common vision – pandemics and great resignations withstanding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-be-the-problem-solver&quot;&gt;3. Be the problem solver&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By leveraging their functional expertise along with the line of sight they have of the business, managers are in a unique position to problem solve complex problems. Leaders rely on their managers for ground-level information to make decisions. Critical thinking can help mid-level managers discern the right information that is needed for leadership decision making, as well as the other way around – how to slice and dice the leadership decisions for their teams so it makes actionable sense to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The one common thread that runs between the above three roles is the ability to hold a mirror to both the leadership and the team members. Managers need to get out of their traditional moulds of receiving strategic business plans and transmitting them to their teams. By adding an additional layer of empathy to the plans, they will create immense value for the business and the employees alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognised by the WHO in 2019 as an “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases&quot;&gt;occupational phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;”, ‘burnout’ is the new workplace epidemic that is catching up faster than anything else since March 2020. Workplace stress and feeling professionally deficient were challenges that employees have always faced but what changed with the onset of the pandemic is the intensity and direction. Stress became all-encompassing with uncertainty and job insecurity high during the early days of the pandemic. Subsequently, logging in for endless hours from home, while being monitored and screen-grabbed added to the tensions - both physical and mental. The pandemic jolted us into the realisation that our mental and physical wellbeing was prime. And if I spend eight to ten hours of my waking day at work, my wellbeing is impacted by the nature of work. No doubt then, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/onemind/2021/10/27/prevent-employee-burnout--or-face-the-great-resignation/?sh=1277eb4cb5b2&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; attribute the Great Resignation to the post-pandemic stress and resultant burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations and governments are indeed taking cognizance of these trends and solving for them. However, it doesn’t take away the need to develop our own personal arsenal as well to prevent ourselves from burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As social creatures, we need to be in contact with others - not just for our once in a while outings but on an everyday basis. Connecting with others, sharing stories, that post-lunch walk or seemingly unproductive water cooler chat - all lead up to one outcome: shielding us from workplace burnout. Think about it - how many times did you step out for fresh air with a colleague after an exhausting presentation, only to come back refreshed. No amount of efficiency tools, productivity resources, and time management principles can replace that. This emerges from &lt;a href=&quot;https://samriddhiconsulting.com/organisation_development/business-case-for-empathy&quot;&gt;Empathetic Concern&lt;/a&gt; - which is shared across our work with colleagues and helps us connect to our work in a much more meaningful way. Empathy can emerge to be one of the strongest tools in this battle against burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the pandemic nowhere close to relenting and our real water-cooler still distant, can empathy still help us in managing burnout as we continue our virtual routines? I have found the following three fundamental principles truly effective in bringing empathy into our work lives in order to keep burnout at bay:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-set-boundaries&quot;&gt;1. Set boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empathy doesn’t always need to be outward. It is important to be empathetic towards your own needs and make time for self-care. Don’t be a hero and take tighter deadlines than needed or more assignments than you can handle. Reach out for help when needed. Raise flags if projects are going off-track to avoid last-minute stresses. Setting clear boundaries on what you can and cannot do helps set expectations and manage burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-build-meaningful-relationships-at-work-and-beyond&quot;&gt;2. Build meaningful relationships at work and beyond&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the surprise of many, it is possible to build a meaningful relationship with colleagues and others, while still at home. For starters, have all your virtual calls with your camera on. Try it for a day and you will feel the difference it has on your mood and overall connect with the person on the other side of the screen. The importance of having team calls beyond work has been talked about so much as well, as has sharing our personal stories, successes and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-ask-insightful-questions&quot;&gt;3. Ask insightful questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking the right questions with empathy can help us understand where the other person is coming from. While our own tensions mat seem overwhelming, it is important to step back and see the situation from the other person’s point of view. This is a huge win in beating stress, avoiding unnecessary conflict and inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These principles can stand in good stead, whether you are working onsite or virtually. Burnout can creep up anytime, anywhere. Let’s bring empathy to work and keep burnout at bay!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vidhi Kumar</name></author><category term="Organisation_Development" /><category term="new-beginnings," /><category term="empathy," /><category term="leadership," /><category term="growth" /><summary type="html">While all of us were busy fighting COVID and dealing with variants, vaccinations, and virtual work, a silent epidemic was creeping upon us.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/assets/images/keep-burnout-at-bay-post.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/assets/images/keep-burnout-at-bay-post.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Business case for empathy</title><link href="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/organisation_development/business-case-for-empathy" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Business case for empathy" /><published>2022-01-10T10:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-01-10T10:30:00+05:30</updated><id>https://samriddhiconsulting.com/organisation_development/business-case-for-empathy</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/organisation_development/business-case-for-empathy">&lt;p&gt;A happy new year and welcome to the season of resolutions! Mine is to focus on the positive and continue my practice of gratitude through this year. Searching for positive news though, in these times is definitely not easy, but I did manage to find one yesterday that made me smile. Following the famous New Year’s Ball Drop in New York City this year, Eric Adams took office as the new mayor. One of the key agendas he wants to drive in his team is to hire for more empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While organisations and leaders have been talking about empathy for several years, it is heartening to see that the need for more empathetic behaviour is entering into wider areas like public service. In his 2006 book – A Whole New Mind – Daniel Pink spoke about how “the capabilities we once disdained or thought frivolous—the ‘right-brain’ qualities of inventiveness, empathy, joyfulness, and meaning—increasingly will determine who flourishes and who flounders.” Domains like medicine and healthcare, education and law will require us to exhibit greater human skills like empathy and creativity, while letting machines and AI handle what they do best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then again, empathy is considered a soft, mushy half-skill, even a personality trait sometimes – indicating that we either have it in us to be empathetic or don’t. Doubt has loomed on whether empathy can actually be measured. These paradoxes got me started to unpack some questions in my head around modern-age empathy and how it manifests in our work lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-is-empathy-a-skill-or-a-personality-trait&quot;&gt;First, is Empathy a skill or a personality trait?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The construct of empathy became widely known after Daniel Goleman talked about it in his 1995 book on Emotional Intelligence. According to Goleman, empathy is basically the ability to understand others’ emotions and there are three types of empathy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive empathy&lt;/strong&gt; – clearly identified as a ‘skill’ that helps us understand what others are thinking. This skill can indeed be learnt to become better communicators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional empathy&lt;/strong&gt; – observed as an ability to tap into your emotions to build a deeper connection with others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathetic concern&lt;/strong&gt; – also referred to as compassionate empathy, this calls for going beyond feeling the emotions, and acting to help the other person.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As humans, we are wired to feel these emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“… the ancient parts of the brain beneath the cortex – the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, and the orbitofrontal cortex – that allow us to feel fast without thinking deeply” enable us to be empathetic at the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, like all skills – empathy also needs practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-how-do-i-learn-empathy&quot;&gt;So, how do I learn empathy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that practicing empathy is actually not that hard. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/our-social-brains/201007/empathy-101&quot;&gt;Scientists have discovered biological evidence that human brain fires “mirror neurons” when we observe and experience emotion.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote text-center bg-light&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;mb-0&quot;&gt;Simply put, in order to try to understand what my team member is going through, my brain is capable of pretending that I am going through a similar situation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to highlight at this point, the difference between empathy and sympathy. Best explained by Dr. Brene Brown in her 2012 book &lt;a href=&quot;https://brenebrown.com/book/daring-greatly/&quot;&gt;Daring Greatly&lt;/a&gt; , empathy makes you vulnerable too. Just pretending to be in a tough spot without a frame of reference will not help build a connect – that is just sympathy. But what if I have never been in that kind of a situation to empathise? As an example, imagine a manager who does not have kids of her own and finds it difficult to connect during a team member’s pregnancy and subsequent maternity period. The situation may sound awkward, but it is very real. The number one tool to build an empathetic connection in such situations is listening. Asking meaningful questions, listening intently and building insights go a long way in enabling empathetic relationships. In brief, you don’t need to have gone through every problem to know how the other person feels. Trust them enough to share their feelings and how they would best use your help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;then-can-the-impact-of-empathy-be-measured&quot;&gt;Then, can the impact of empathy be measured?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of modern research and management studies that point to the fact that empathy in fact is great for business and profitability. Here are three reasons that I could strongly resonate with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-empathy-helps-you-build-greater-customer-connect-and-innovate-in-order-to-build-better-products-and-solve-problems&quot;&gt;1. Empathy helps you build greater customer connect and innovate in order to build better products and solve problems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding customers’ unmet needs, articulating them and trying to solve those is at the core of a customer-centric, innovative business. In fact, Telefonica Germany implemented a nation-wide &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2015/01/corporate-empathy-is-not-an-oxymoron&quot;&gt;“empathy training program that led to an increase in customer satisfaction of 6% within 6 weeks.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy pays.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-empathetic-leaders-build-bonded-teams-that-are-willing-to-go-over-and-beyond-what-is-defined-in-their-job-descriptions&quot;&gt;2. Empathetic leaders build bonded teams that are willing to go over and beyond what is defined in their job descriptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders who communicate with empathy ensure that their team members also feel heard and valued. They build environments where each individual’s strengths are leveraged, and everyone feels fulfilled while working towards a common goal. Further, empathetic leaders care, and true genuine care is the most important currency in today’s uncertain times, when employee needs can vary from safety to mental wellness and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-empathy-makes-for-socially-responsible-businesses-that-care-for-the-ecosystem-they-operate-in-and-define-a-strong-sustainable-journey-for-themselves&quot;&gt;3. Empathy makes for socially responsible businesses that care for the ecosystem they operate in and define a strong sustainable journey for themselves&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses have the power to transcend boundaries and go beyond just economic causes. Leveraging this power needs leaders to be empathetic towards a larger world view and care about the causes that are important. Environment care, diversity and inclusion, climate change, and generating employment are pertinent causes that tie in closely with businesses, allowing them to make a larger difference outside of their balance sheets and build strong brands&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes courage for leaders like Eric Adams to break the mould and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/18/nyregion/eric-adams-emotional-intelligence.html&quot;&gt;ask for greater empathy in teams and organisations&lt;/a&gt;. It is inspiring to see this change, read the definite research in favour of empathy and celebrate leaders who build businesses with an empathetic concern. Here’s hoping for more empathy in our businesses.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vidhi Kumar</name></author><category term="Organisation_Development" /><category term="new-beginnings," /><category term="empathy," /><category term="leadership," /><category term="growth" /><summary type="html">A happy new year and welcome to the season of resolutions!

In many ways, I am glad the year went by so quick. What started off with a resurgence of hope and normalcy, quickly turned horrifying, but is finally ending with everyone cautiously making their way into the new normal. ‘New normal’ was the go-to phrase of last year but it is this year that we have truly started to appreciate the meaning of the phrase and its gravity on our lives. Moving on from losses, displaying courage, transcending all differences to help each other, and weaving safety into the fabric of everything we do – the year has taught us many lessons that will stay with us and become our DNA. Here are my top three lessons which will help me navigate towards growth and positivity in the new year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#resilience&quot;&gt;Resilience and the Ability to bounce back &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#innovation&quot;&gt;Innovative Problem-Solving&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#sustainability&quot;&gt;Sustainability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resilience&quot;&gt;1. Resilience &amp;amp; the ability to bounce back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start with this lesson because at the core of all of our existence is the ability to collect ourselves from whatever we have been through and move on. Psychologist and author &lt;a href=&quot;https://angeladuckworth.com/&quot;&gt;Angela Duckworth&lt;/a&gt; indicates Resilience as the ability to bounce back after we have struggled or failed. The key to resilience is often being able to see across the darkness and just know that there is light. No one will tell you that. It comes from deep-seated optimism, faith and self-awareness. It also needs us to be gritty – to never give up trying to work towards a better tomorrow. In many ways, this is the most important milestone as we chart our road towards growth and building a better tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;innovation&quot;&gt;2. Innovative Problem Solving&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am probably cheating a little here by clubbing two critical lessons into one! However, in my defence, this year has pushed our limits to try and solve problems we never knew existed. Vaccinating your workforce was never part of any organisational job description. With businesses returning to normalcy during the first half of the year, so many of us innovated to make sure each one of their employees – no matter how remote – was safely vaccinated. This is just one example that I’m sure resonates with many of us. Several other such case studies have proven that a straight-jacketed approach to work will not work in the future. Boundaries will have to be redefined and problems will need to be seen from an innovative lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sustainability&quot;&gt;3. Sustainability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lesson is closest to me – personally and professionally. When we started out, at Samriddhi Consulting, we made a conscious decision to choose sustainable growth projects that were meaningful and had a long-term impact on the business. However, the post-pandemic appreciation of our environment had a deeper personal impact on me. I started seriously reading up about Sustainability and realised that it is not the same as ‘environmental-ism’! Sustainability is defined by the United Nations as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote text-center bg-light&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;mb-0&quot;&gt;development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer class=&quot;blockquote-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/5987our-common-future.pdf&quot;&gt;The United Nations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can work across the entire spectrum of activities we are involved in – social and economic. For the longest time, we were limited by our thinking that this balance is unachievable, but sometimes a jolt is needed to make us realise that what we have been taking for granted isn’t possible anymore. Work from home proved that we could reduce our carbon footprint by travelling less. 2021 has been the year when #netzero and EarthShot became forces of action towards preserving our climate. The scarcity of fuel in Britain this year was another bolt for us to consider electric vehicles seriously. Several &lt;a href=&quot;https://interestingengineering.com/21-sustainability-innovations-that-might-just-change-the-world&quot;&gt;start-ups&lt;/a&gt; are successfully and profitably engaging in responsible businesses to create a better future. My personal commitment this year has been to reduce my carbon footprint and I started by measuring mine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/carbon-footprint-calculator/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As a vegetarian, who doesn’t drive around much now, I was disappointed to find out that my carbon footprint is 5.49 tonnes of CO2e as against the global average of 4 tonnes per year. But as we say, the journey towards improvement begins with measuring!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On that note, I’m looking forward to a year when I can be conscious about my personal impact on this planet and reduce to at least 4 tonnes of CO2e by next time this year and use my resilience and innovation to get there. So much for public commitments 😊 Here’s wishing all of you a wonderful festive season as well and best wishes as we ring in a new year.&lt;/p&gt;

Moving on from losses, displaying courage, transcending all differences to help each other, and weaving safety into the fabric of everything we do – the year has taught us many lessons that will stay with us and become our DNA. Here are my top three lessons which will help me navigate towards growth and positivity in the new year:</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/assets/images/2021-growth-lessons-post.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/assets/images/2021-growth-lessons-post.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The debate about returning to the office</title><link href="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/organisation_development/return-to-office" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The debate about returning to the office" /><published>2021-10-29T10:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-10-29T10:30:00+05:30</updated><id>https://samriddhiconsulting.com/organisation_development/return-to-office</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/organisation_development/return-to-office">&lt;p&gt;Since March 2020, organisations have been caught in a mass-scale social experiment, never seen before, never imagined! Last year, every organisation went into a massive work from home experiment, overnight. Most were unprepared and several took months to adjust. Sixteen months on, with most of us double vaccinated, the question that looms in our minds now is - whether to return to office or not. Organisational pundits have predicted a hybrid model - one that can work in a few different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before deciding what is the best ‘return-to-work’ strategy for a particular organisation, there are several factors that need to be considered – some tangible (like productivity, cost, and employee preferences) while others not so tangible (like impact on innovation and collaboration). Let’s look at it from a three-fold perspective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#how&quot;&gt;How work is delivered in your organisation?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#where&quot;&gt;Where are your business’ touchpoints?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#who&quot;&gt;Who is your mission-critical talent and what inspires them?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how&quot;&gt;1. How work is delivered in your organisation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deconstruct your business model and take a bold look at which pieces can be digitised or have already been automated. The pandemic has forced most organisations to adopt a digital-first approach. If most of your suppliers, employees, and customers are technologically enabled and connected, the advantage offered by a return-to-office approach is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, digitised organisations too have a need to unplug and come face-to-face. If your business model is based on intense and ongoing research, innovation, and team brainstorming, the need for these teams to come together occasionally and safely must be catered to within your return-to-work strategy. Whether this is through periodic team meetings or a quarterly retreat – options abound!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important factor to consider here is the organisation culture. Organisation cultures, like people’s personalities, are unique and often intangible. This is where you need to have maximum conversation with team leaders and listen intently to your employees. Does your organisation display the resilience and agility needed when working remotely? Are your leaders equipped to uphold the organisation’s culture without traditional levers like face-to-face town halls or physical meetings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reimagine your work across all functions from the lens of digitalisation, automation, culture, and adaptability to narrow down to the right mix of in-person time your teams need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where&quot;&gt;2. Where are your business’ touchpoints?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The location of your current business points of contact will have a huge impact on what kind of hybrid model you want to adopt. The approach will vary widely for an organisation that has multiple retail outlets versus one from a core manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor to be considered here is how your workplace supports and enables productivity. Most organisations have reported that their employees are more productive while working from home. However, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-effects-of-remote-work-on-collaboration-among-information-workers/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 61000 Microsoft employees revealed that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote text-center bg-light&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;mb-0&quot;&gt;while productivity rose during remote work, collaboration became “more static and siloed”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer class=&quot;blockquote-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-effects-of-remote-work-on-collaboration-among-information-workers/&quot;&gt;The effects of remote work on collaboration among information workers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations need to identify their primary channels of communication – formal and informal, internal and external – and these channels ought to cover both work and non-work aspects like organisational engagement and team bonding. Some teams are immensely comfortable bonding over Slack or Teams chat while others lose tacit knowledge if they don’t meet at the water cooler. Where these conversations take place within your organisations is critical to identify and feed into your return-to-work policy too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who&quot;&gt;3. Who is your mission-critical talent and what inspires them?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons organisations are rethinking the ‘how’ and ‘where’ of work in the future is because a significant population of their workforce wants to keep the flexibility. In fact, according to one EY survey,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote text-center bg-light&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;mb-0&quot;&gt;more than half of employees globally would quit their jobs if not provided post-pandemic flexibility &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer class=&quot;blockquote-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2021/05/more-than-half-of-employees-globally-would-quit-their-jobs-if-not-provided-post-pandemic-flexibility-ey-survey-finds&quot;&gt;2021 EY Work Reimagined Employee Survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this talent that you will lose from return-to-work policies is easily replaceable, the answer is clear. On the flip side, is your mission-critical hard to find where your physical offices are located? Or, have you been trying to drive an inclusion and diversity agenda for years with no luck? This is the time for you to bolster your talent strategy – make it agile and inclusive. You no longer need to be limited to one city, state, or country to find the right talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, consider the capabilities of your team leaders and managers. How does your organisation develop talent? Is coaching a structured intervention within the organisation or do managers like to mentor their teams over a face-to-face meeting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not the least, consider role definitions and how can the talent be built to fill those roles. For fully remote roles and hybrid roles, talent sourcing is easier but you may need to invest more behind upskilling. However, roles that are fully on-site or hybrid by exception need more investment behind talent access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Blending in-office and remote workers present organisations with new challenges. As this future of work faces us, we need to look at the larger purpose of offices and how they enable organisations and teams to support their unique cultures and brand personalities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Is a cotton mask better than an N95 mask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Should we buy a face shield?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Can we have friends over for a tea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Which sanitiser is safest for our family?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past sixteen months have thrown a myriad of decisions at us – most that were unused to or had no precedent to refer to for. Add to it the ever-changing information we received every day about the virus and how to deal with it. This overload of information weighed down on our minds, clouding our decision-making abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Known as &lt;strong&gt;decision fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;, this strain on our decision-making faculties is due to mental exhaustion or being forced to go through multiple complex choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-decision-fatigue-real&quot;&gt;Is decision fatigue real?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt – decision fatigue is a real threat in this post-pandemic new normal. It’s not a new phenomenon, however. We have heard of leaders and businesspeople dressing up in similar outfits to avoid the need to make complex styling decisions every morning. Barack Obama and Mark Zuckerberg being the classic and oft-quoted examples here. The key psychological concept here being that by freeing up the brain from taking redundant or repetitive decisions, the brain can focus its decision-making capabilities on more complex circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision making by itself, even on the best of days, is a tough skill to master. In these unprecedented circumstances, it becomes more depleted because we have no experience of taking these new decisions. What, then, is the impact on us and our decision making when faced with this barrage of questions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision fatigue is not just a feeling of tiredness. It has a real impact on our physiology and the outcomes of our decisions. According to one study,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote text-center bg-light&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;mb-0&quot;&gt;chess grandmasters often burn up to 6,000 calories per day when participating in high-level tournaments due to the intense stress of the strategic decisions they’re making. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer class=&quot;blockquote-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90677496/one-unlikely-culprit-to-burnout-youre-lack-of-laziness&quot;&gt;Why a lack of lazy behavior is increasing your burnout (fastcompany.com)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased brain activity is indeed a real drain on energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, research also shows that decision fatigue affects the part of the brain associated with cognition and self-control. This implies that decision fatigue can, on the one hand, cause us to take impulse actions (like binge eating or shopping) and on the other hand, get us into analysis paralysis (like delaying important decisions). Being at either end of this spectrum can be a risky proposition and lead to poor decision outcomes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-avoid-decision-fatigue&quot;&gt;How to avoid decision fatigue?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that so many months into the pandemic, it is now possible to take control of our lives and the decisions around them, to a large extent. Some proven ways to avoid decision fatigue are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-self-awareness&quot;&gt;1. Self-awareness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing what the source of your decision fatigue is and how your brain is responding to it is the first step in helping yourself avoid it. Understand your cognitive waves like the time of the day when you take your best decisions. Flow with your natural energy instead of trying to cram your day with activities as they come. For example, as a morning person, I never leave critical decisions till the end of the day. I know they will get my depleted mind share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-simplify-or-automate-choices&quot;&gt;2. Simplify or automate choices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn from Obama and Zuckerberg! Clothes is an easy decision to automate. I also like to automate grocery shopping, menu planning for the week and other such mundane decisions which drain my energy otherwise. The idea is simple - pick your battles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-have-an-ally&quot;&gt;3. Have an ally&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision fatigue affects all of us. Rely on your allies to help you through the low stretch and vice versa. Enlist close friends and family members to flag off poor decisions when you are fatigued. Also, try delegating decisions where stakes are lower for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burnout is the enemy of good decision making. Just as self-care and health have become important parts of the modern productivity toolkit, decision strength is an element that can no longer be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vidhi Kumar</name></author><category term="Instructional_Design" /><category term="decision" /><category term="fatigue," /><category term="productivity," /><category term="new-normal," /><category term="burnout," /><category term="decision" /><category term="making" /><summary type="html">Is a cotton mask better than an N95 mask?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/assets/images/decision-fatigue-post.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/assets/images/decision-fatigue-post.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Why is my Online Training not effective?</title><link href="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/instructional_design/online-training-effectiveness" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why is my Online Training not effective?" /><published>2021-09-20T10:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-09-20T10:30:00+05:30</updated><id>https://samriddhiconsulting.com/instructional_design/online-training-effectiveness</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/instructional_design/online-training-effectiveness">&lt;p&gt;You may ask that you have tried everything from using breakout rooms to online quizzes and fun videos to engage your learners. Why then do your learners still sit with their audio and video muted in the v-ILT sessions? Why are the learning completion metrics on your LMS still low? Why do you still have to follow up with learners to log-in and complete their learning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, I would step back to the fundamentals of instructional design. The first step is called Training Needs Assessment (TNA). It may seem like an extremely simple place to start from, but I cannot over emphasize the importance of a good need assessment because it forms the very backbone of your program. TNA is often under-rated or limited to subjective discussion-based tools. Poor understanding of the learning objectives will inadvertently lead to poor effectiveness of the program delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may not seem like but validating learning outcomes through a detailed need assessment is in fact the less time-consuming step, as compared to what follows! This is also because at Samriddhi, we have template-ised this crucial step, so you never miss out the finer details in conducting your TNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step after TNA is what causes most of us maximum discomfort – discerning which category your learning outcomes fall into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowledge dissemination, or&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skill building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes possible to confuse between these two. Consider a training on negotiation skills – do you want your learners to understand the process of negotiation? Or do you want them to develop their own style, practice it and apply it in work situations? Now who doesn’t want the latter, right? But are we then ready to commit ourselves to achieving that learning outcome? Hence it is important to understand the trade-offs between choosing between the &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;skill&lt;/em&gt; buckets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this is important is because &lt;em&gt;sticky&lt;/em&gt; learning is only achieved when we treat learning as a process, and not as an event. So, while an information dissemination training can fall into the first bucket and be an isolated learning event, application of skills or behaviours to workplace situations, needs significant time and effort. It is this stickiness that makes the online training truly effective and is therefore brings in the concept of &lt;em&gt;performance support&lt;/em&gt; in learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance-supported learning answers one question: “How does my learning program enhance the performance of my learners?” And because it is such a bottom-line driven question, measuring the effectiveness of the online training is built into the program design from a very early stage.
Consider a simple example. If a learner scores high scores on all knowledge quizzes in the program, would that count towards program effectiveness? Not so much, right? However, if the learner demonstrates that she/he can apply the learning in real life situations, the program be considered effective. The idea is to replicate the learning environment as closely as possible to the actual workplace and introduce key concepts by linking them to the learners’ pre-existing knowledge, skill or behaviour patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is what makes performance-supported learning so interesting too. It offers endless opportunities to innovate on the content, experiment with varied instructional design tools and incorporate relevant workplace-linked assessments. Some different instructional design tools we have used in the recent past are scenario-based tests, job aids, video tutorial, system simulation, feedback-based role plays, etc. These are called learning scaffolding, which supports the learner as s/he walks through the process of picking up the new skill. With subsequent steps in the learning journey, we reduce the scaffolding, giving greater confidence to the learner to apply the skills in real-life scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise, make sure to run a strong training needs analysis before designing your program and use performance-supported learning to make your online programs more effective. We would love to hear more from you about your experiences and challenges in making online training effective.&lt;/p&gt;

Our son has been taking all his assessments on Microsoft Teams through Forms. Many tell me that he’s lucky to have access to these tools, and I couldn’t be more grateful for that. But as a parent, I get horrified seeing test after test in Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) format, dumbing down education to memorisation of answers rather than discerning of facts and articulating balanced opinions. The past 16 months of virtual schooling have me worried – not for academic loss, but the learning loss. And these are distinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain what I mean with the help of a commonly used example. Have you ever come across some version of the below sentence/ words in a brain teaser or a puzzle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;mb-0&quot;&gt;Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer class=&quot;blockquote-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/cmabridge/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have, I’m sure you could identify the above-jumbled sentence as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote text-center bg-light&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;mb-0&quot;&gt;According to a researcher (sic) at Cambridge University, it doesn't matter in what order the letters in a word are, the only important thing is that the first and last letter be at the right place&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer class=&quot;blockquote-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/cmabridge/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author of the above article himself isn’t sure if this research was done at the University of Cambridge, but empirical evidence of trying out this puzzle with several members of friends and family shows that it is true to a large extent. &lt;strong&gt;Now here is the caveat, and my point about learning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apply the same rule of retaining the first and last letters in the word, and unscramble this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;mb-0&quot;&gt;Pncaaltel gtworh fotcar in asnessemst of wmoen wtih seutspced pre-esmplacia to reudce mtrnaael miobdrtiy: a seepptd wgede cletsur renioamsdd crotonl taril&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took much longer, right? (By the way, find the solution at the end of the article, if you didn’t solve it!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unscramble exercise is not as simple if the words are unfamiliar, for example, technical terms. The brain needs to then stop and think. It needs to search for similar words or make&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sense of the given letters. In other words, it gets challenged. Similar to what happens to the brain when we work on a complex problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When solving complex problems, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) or the “higher” brain gets activated. This part of the brain controls higher-order functions like reflection, emotional response, cognitive flexibility, and long-term memory. One such higher-order function of the PFC is Critical Thinking, which you just applied while solving the above word scrambles. Your brain searched for similar words, efficiently drew synapses from what you’ve known, and made calculated estimates to find an answer. Like any muscle, the more you exercise your brain and stretch it to make these connections, the better it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical thinking has emerged as one of the top five Skills of the Future according to the World Economic Forum study 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the OECD ‘Skills for 2030’ Concept Note&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote text-center bg-light&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;mb-0&quot;&gt;Critical thinking includes inductive and deductive reasoning, making correct analyses, inferences and evaluations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer class=&quot;blockquote-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oecd.org/education/2030-project/teaching-and-learning/learning/skills/Skills_for_2030_concept_note.pdf&quot;&gt;Facione et al., 1995&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the workplace, Critical Thinking refers to the ability to logically break down a complex problem, without either getting overwhelmed by it or getting bogged down into details. At Samriddhi, we call this the “agility to zoom in and zoom out”. Critical thinking needs a person to look at a problem from a solutioning perspective and be creative about the solution. As a workplace competency, you may find that it overlaps with several other competencies like emotional intelligence, data analysis, analytical thinking, and clear communication – clearly articulating the thought process, asking the right questions, and analysing information without biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is what makes it a little harder to develop. It is a nuanced and complex skill, which requires technique, persistent effort, and practice. In an age of information overload, we need to constantly keep filtering out incorrect data and gather relevant information, interpret and analyse it, evaluate arguments, recognise unstated assumptions, and make decisions. Fortunately, there are proven techniques that can help build critical thinking. Removing unconscious biases while interpreting information is key to thinking clearly. (View Samriddhi Consulting’s &lt;a href=&quot;/organisation_development/cognitive_biases_primer&quot;&gt;Cognitive Biases Primer&lt;/a&gt;, if you missed attending our Diversity workshop). Another useful technique for building critical thinking is Appreciative Inquiry and asking effective questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more these techniques are practiced and the sooner they are introduced, the more they become a part of one’s a natural thinking process. Circling back to where I started this blog post, it is this learning loss or lack of skill-building that I will continue to worry about during this virtual schooling experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

For multiple reasons! On a personal note, for the first time, I was able to introduce my son - now eleven - to the glory of the world’s largest sporting event! Five years ago, he was too young to appreciate the grandeur of this event, all that goes into its planning (especially this unprecedented one), the training the athletes go through, the wide range of sporting events that it supports (BMX is his favourite by the way!!) and the diversity of nations that participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a sporting fan, as I’ve shared earlier. However, the beauty of these events is in what it teaches us beyond the sporting techniques. It warmed my heart to see Naomi Osaka light the Olympic flame, which passed through the deserving hands of so many young and old athletes, frontline workers, and school students. A perfect example of inclusion when we are planning any event as an organisation. I was immediately reminded of my first manager who would always insist that any HR intervention we plan must reach the last mile of the organisation and truly resonate with every member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sporting events were a delight to watch even for those of us who don’t follow the sport on a regular basis. We spent an entire Sunday afternoon watching archery qualifiers and cheered for Atanu Das and Deepika Kumari!! How did that event engage me so deeply, I wondered later? I zeroed it down to two factors. One, the sheer passion of the athletes was so infectious that it permeated through the screen and had me invested in their matches. I geekily identified the second factor though as an instructional design strategy. A bite-sized video explaining every sport that helped bring viewers like me up to speed. In a matter of 60 seconds, the fast-paced video showed us the rules, the tricks, and the skills to appreciate in the sport. Voila! It was the perfect &lt;a href=&quot;/instructional_design/jitl&quot;&gt;Just-in-Time Learning&lt;/a&gt; session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, how can any thoughts on Tokyo 2020 be complete without a reference to the seven medals that India won in the Olympics and the four we won in the less talked about Paralympics? These may seem like a minuscule number in front of the top countries on the tally chart, but this Olympics was not about just winning a medal for those athletes. It was about showing unprecedented levels of grit and resilience, about patience and hard work, about relentless practice without access to comparable facilities. These medals are about ‘despite’ rather than ‘because of’ and taking the first step in the direction of winning - initiating. Mirabai’s humble abode, Ravi Dahiya’s simple village, Neeraj Chopra’s spartan training grounds - all may pale in comparison to where the top Olympians come from. However, instead of feeling victimised, these athletes took control of their passion and charged through the barriers between their skill and their achievements, and the future belongs to those of us who have taken charge of ourselves. They recognised their talent, took responsibility for training themselves, and stayed engaged in this uphill road to the medal. Even the Indian women’s hockey team that missed the medal by a whisker, has many inspiring stories to share of how they began their journey to the semi-finals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last blog post, I referred to the fact that learning and development of an employee is no longer the onus of the organisation or HR. It is for the employee to take charge of her/ his development, or face redundancy in this rapidly changing economy. As the world of work around us changes in ways we have never imagined, we cannot afford to stick to the old ways and depend on others for our growth, wellbeing and success. This is the time when we need to take charge of what we want to learn, how we want to learn it and when. While workplaces have been significantly disrupted because of the pandemic, what has emerged from this disruption is also a freedom to delink work from time and geography. It has given room for every employee to curate individual learning journeys and roadmaps that will meet her/ his unique career aspirations and work to her/ his individual strengths and opportunities – just like our Olympians this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo 2020 has taught us a lot, but my biggest takeaway is the value of taking initiative and not depending on anyone else to train, to engage or to be gritty.

The more you read and deliberate over a particular subject, the more interesting it keeps getting. More branches keep emerging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something similar happened to me when I wrote my blog post on Naomi Osaka and vulnerability a few weeks back. One thing led to another, and I can’t stop thinking about how the constructs of vulnerability and trust intermingle at workplace – from leadership to now my latest muse, how does it manifest in the new normal remote workplace?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an independent consultant, I started working from home in late 2019 – much before the pandemic struck. Even before that, I was fortunate to have worked in a culture that encouraged flexibility and trusted me to deliver outcomes – not clock hours! So, when the lockdown first started, I heard several of my friends and associates share horror tales of being in front of the laptop camera for 9 hours, having to deliver daily reports of how they have used their day (some subtly but mostly not), keeping their teams busy with meaningless work because otherwise they don’t know how else to show productivity and worse – being micromanaged using time-sheet tools!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mixed emotions of gratitude for not being in their situation and despair for not being able to help, got me thinking about the reasons behind such behaviours. I also did a few webinars on working in the new normal, but frustratingly most of the questions by participants were around ‘monitoring’ employees. With time, employers and employees started accepting that this was how things were going to be, but every time there is a dip in the pandemic and the lockdown is eased, employees are called back into work. You’re probably nodding your head right now as you’re reading this, if you’re one of those back at work – all masked up and stocked with sanitisers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you’re a factory supervisor or a sales manager, I get it that your work requires you to be on field. However, if a corporate staff member is asked to work from office on a regular basis, I sense that there is a trust deficit in the organisational culture. Trust itself is a complex paradigm. Layer it up with the complexities of the pandemic and it becomes truly hard to comprehend. However, I am attempting to see trust in the new normal from the following three dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care&lt;/strong&gt;: The cornerstone of any relationship during these unprecedented times, I would place authentic and genuine care about your team members ahead of any other thought. The keyword being authentic, of course!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competence&lt;/strong&gt;: I would have normally put this first, but these are tough times. Even then, competence cannot be traded for any other trait at work. If an employee is struggling to deliver, to understand what is expected of her/ him, is unable to ask the right questions and seek help when needed, is finding it difficult to use the empowerment provided – then I would be reluctant to trust such a team member. This is especially true of a time when I cannot see where s/he is struggling and s/he isn’t able to articulate it well enough, even if I can take time out to coach the employee. Being remote puts the onus of development and competence building on the employee – and that’s an interesting topic for my next blog post hopefully😊&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication&lt;/strong&gt;: I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this dimension. From being extremely clear in the goals and expectations of an employee to establishing a cadence for check-ins and reviews to finally, providing constructive and timely feedback to the employee, communication is the spine that runs all along a remote work environment. Moreover, do you really think that in a virtual setting, our erstwhile communication principles of ‘70% efficacy comes from body language’ will still hold ground? Words have become so important – and hence it is critical we communicate clearly, with simple words and confirm that the other person has understood our message. Assuming that the person on the other side of the laptop screen has read your defensive body language or the sad eye expression is setting you up for major surprises!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot being written and discussed about how workplace relationships are changing in the new normal. Trust is just one building block of organisational culture that is undergoing major flux. Data security, organisational policies, and business models are some of the others. All of these inter-mingle and have a lot to do with how trust manifests in an organisation to define what shape its culture will take when the dust settles on this pandemic. Let’s hope it’s a shape that enables us all to bring our best to work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vidhi Kumar</name></author><category term="organisation_development" /><summary type="html">Has it ever happened to you that you start thinking about or reading a particular topic and then every discussion that you have leads up to the same topic?
