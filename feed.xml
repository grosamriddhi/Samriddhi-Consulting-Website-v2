    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly why I’m a fan of virtual facilitations! It brings people from different corners of the world together. Perhaps more importantly, it helps me filter the truly keen learners from those who have been mandated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our certified diversity facilitator workshop on March 2nd was another testimony to my belief. All of us were there in that frame because we truly believed in the cause of inclusion. The discussions in the breakout rooms were evidence of how engaged a virtual setup can get because as a participant I am getting views from such a diverse audience about D&amp;amp;I. We all stayed till the end because we really wanted to reflect on what insights Shruthi Gokuldas - our fireside chat guest - had to bring in. Rarely do you come across a leader who is willing to use her stories and vulnerabilities to drive home important learnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of the format further lent itself to deeper engagement. By sharing the pre-read on Cognitive Bias in advance, we had already primed the minds of our participants towards the session content. Such a format is powerful because it puts control into the learners’ hands. It required us to reach out to our participants in advance, through multiple channels but it was well worth it. They have the choice to read the content when they are in the best state to absorb that learning, leaving their minds free to absorb more during the actual session. The neuroscience of learning teaches us a thing or two about transferring pre-reads from our short-term memory to long-term memory! Critical content (in this case, the primer on Cognitive Bias because it forms the foundation of understanding diversity) should not only be shared in advance but also allowed to sit in the learners’ minds for at least one sleep cycle, thereafter reinforcing it (in our case, with a quickfire quiz!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got really ambitious in our breakout room activity and I want to thank every single one of our participants for engaging so deeply with the intense content. Breakouts lend themselves to open and candid discussions, diverse thoughts and clearer convergence because they allow people to work in small comfortable groups, where everyone has a voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s technology of course which I love! Virtual collaboration boards have replaced coloured post-it notes so efficiently. I never anyway liked the struggle of keeping the post-its stuck to the whiteboard whilst you debrief your activity! Besides, use the right tools, and you can keep the responses anonymous thereby creating a safe, open space for everyone to come forward and share ideas if you so plan in your activity. This is especially important for a topic like diversity and inclusion, where we struggle with our deep-rooted unconscious biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our certified diversity facilitator workshop has been a journey well begun… A journey that has brought together people who believe in a strong cause of inclusion and making a difference through diversity. This is exactly the reason why we brought on-board Sumana Dutta from the Akshadhaa Foundation as our inclusion partner. Her tireless efforts on ensuring how people of different abilities can be integrated into the mainstream of organisations are critical to our context today and resonate deeply with us at Samriddhi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, diversity is not a once in a year reminder on a special day. It is not an elitist cause to support. It is a belief, a future that we believe is sustainable because it makes business sense. And I am today proud to have taken a small step to create this community.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cognitive Biases Primer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With their origins in the hunter-gatherer evolution of humans, cognitive biases are deeply rooted into our neuroscience​. These are mental shortcuts (known as heuristics), that help us make sense of the vast information around us​. Without them, we will be crippled when it comes to fast decision making and survival.​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-theres-nothing-wrong-with-having-unconscious-bias-right-&quot;&gt;So there’s nothing wrong with having unconscious bias, right? ​&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not entirely!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;​Unconscious bias is great for survival and ‘fast’ decision making, as Daniel Kahneman would put it - System 1 Thinking (Thinking, Fast and Slow – 2013)​.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, ‘slow’ and deliberate thinking (System 2 Thinking) requires us to remove these filters​&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good news is – it’s possible to work-around these biases once you are aware how to spot them. Let’s look at the top 10 biases that can cloud your decision making at a workplace and how to work around them.​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-types-of-cognitive-bias&quot;&gt;10 Types of Cognitive Bias:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Likeability Bias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affinity Bias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attribution Bias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirmation Bias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Halo (or Horns) Effect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proximity Bias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bandwagon Bias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loss Aversion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anchoring Bias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Availability Heuristic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                &lt;h4 class=&quot;card-title&quot;&gt;Likeability Bias&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;Rooted in how we expect people of certain groups to behave, this bias leads us to liking people who behave as per these expectations. For example, men are liked when they are assertive, women when they are gentle and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul class=&quot;list-group list-group-flush&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h5 class=&quot;card-subtitle list-group-item border-top border-bottom-0 text-muted&quot;&gt;Manifestations at work&lt;/h5&gt;
                    &lt;ul class=&quot;list-group list-group-flush&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;li class=&quot;list-group-item border-0&quot;&gt;A woman may assert her ideas and face ‘likeability penalty’, getting her ideas shot down. &lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li class=&quot;list-group-item border-0&quot;&gt;A young intern is not liked for questioning established processes and suggesting new ones&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;

                        &lt;li class=&quot;list-group-item border-0&quot;&gt;Institute standard, competency-based processes for evaluation of ideas and performance, regardless of who is assessing or being assessed&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;    
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;Our tendency to gravitate towards people like ourselves in appearance, beliefs, and background. Flip side, we may avoid or even dislike people different from us.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul class=&quot;list-group list-group-flush&quot;&gt;

                    &lt;ul class=&quot;list-group list-group-flush&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;li class=&quot;list-group-item border-0&quot;&gt;The classic ‘culture fit’ hiring – we are unconsciously falling for someone who reminds us of ourselves&lt;/li&gt;

                        &lt;li class=&quot;list-group-item border-0&quot;&gt;Start talking about ‘culture adds’ rather than ‘culture fits’&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;h4 class=&quot;card-title&quot;&gt;Attribution Bias&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;Attribution bias is a phenomenon where you try to make sense of or judge a person’s behavior based on prior observations and interactions you’ve had with that group represented by the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making Virtual Performance Management count</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s that time of the year again. We are scheduling reviews, blocking one-on-ones with direct reports and managers, and going over our performance records (even photos of that virtual game show you hosted to showcase your team management skills!). Like every year, performance management time brings a certain whiff in the air – part excitement, part trepidation and definitely a lot of time pressure. 
But that was every year and 2020 has not been like ‘every’ year! 
Just like the other aspects of people management, performance appraisals are also impacted this year. With most of the workforce working remotely for a large part of the year and many targets getting impacted, companies are rethinking their performance metrics closely. Not only are organisations reconsidering the year-gone-by, they are also reviewing how new targets should be set up. 
One could see an opportunity in this adversity. Many organisations are evaluating a move from their traditional annual performance appraisal cycle to the continuous performance cycle or an OKR-based (Objective and Key Results) approach. This was something that so many of us were mulling over for years but never found the right nudge. 2020 seems to have given everyone the right reasons to shed the traditional performance approach and move in favour of more progressive ones. 
There’s no doubt that this year’s performance exercise will be unlike anyone in the past. While there are several differences, we have put together this go-to guide to help us tide over one unique aspect of this year’s exercise – remote appraisals! For many managers, this could be the first time that their employees are not face-to-face with them during the appraisal. This guide is to help them prepare better and ensure they make the best of the appraisal session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1---choose-an-appropriate-environment&quot;&gt;1.   Choose an appropriate environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distractions are a reality in the virtual meeting, and so are technological ‘glitches’. Being prepared for both is important. Don’t keep a meeting immediately before or after your one-on-one with a team member. Encourage the team member to do the same. Work out a time when both of you are most productive to avoid virtual fatigue. Also align times with other people at home – perhaps a time when your internet bandwidth will be used least! 
The review should definitely be a video-based session otherwise it will slip into a monologue of one person talking, and the other listening with their audio and video switched off! 
And just like you would keep your review documents ready in a physical feedback session, keep everything handy for screen share in this case. If your organisation’s people practices allow, it might even be a good idea to share the doc ahead of the meeting, so your team members can go through it with less anxiety and jot down their thoughts or doubts. This way you can focus the meeting on actionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2---be-realistic&quot;&gt;2.   Be realistic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 was tough for everyone – some more than others. Have you taken a good assessment of how targets changed during the year for your team members? If you had already called this out sometime during the year, great! If not, this may be a good time to have a detailed discussion around what comprises of realistic goals. Use these one-on-one’s to read the pulse on your team members better and build confidence that their performance is being fairly evaluated in the light of the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, look at the team members who have gone over and above their work. Did they adapt their styles to meet the goals? Did they take extra initiative in another area? Did they do something that was not there on their original KRA sheet? Discuss with your HR beforehand, what your approach is to handle these outliers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-coach-more-listen-more&quot;&gt;3.	Coach more, listen more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic performance feedback session is a discussion where the managers and employee speak about KRAs one by one, listen to manager feedback and close with ratings. This year calls for more. More listening. More understanding. More empathy. Your team members have gone through a lot to achieve what they have. Give them the platform to share their stories – struggle or valour as it may be! 
Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is a great tool to coach your team members in this situation, instead of just giving a direct feedback. AI is a strengths-based model that seeks to engage your audience in self-determined change. Because it focuses on the positive and encourages change from within, the results are far more sustaining that any other feedback model and that’s the reason we at Samriddhi also love using this tool a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-think-out-of-the-box&quot;&gt;4.	Think out of the box&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use your creativity this performance appraisal. Think of new metrics that may be more relevant in a virtual work setup, for e.g. response time could be an easy metric to find. Review notes from your slack or teams’ channels or zoom recordings. This could also be the time to really start implementing a competency framework if you don’t already. It takes all subjectivity out of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now more than ever, a performance appraisal must be evidence-based and competency-focused. As we continue to be less visible, any rating of performance must be well-thought through and backed-up with examples of behaviors. Consider making 2021 goals short, objective and adaptive. Also, consider increasing the frequency of your performance discussions.
Here’s wishing everyone a highly productive appraisal season in this new normal!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adapting GTM practice to the New Normal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When the pandemic struck, it was evident that it would cause a tectonic change in the Go-to-Market (GTM) world. With so much turbulence, we decided to focus our GTM efforts in managing our Instructional Design practice, to weather the storm. As the skies cleared, it became immediately apparent that we had to zoom into our GTM practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have officially and audaciously split our GTM work into three key areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;communitymanagement,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;funnelmanagement, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;userexperience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;community-management&quot;&gt;Community Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with my experience around the Maggi crisis, I saw first-hand, a failure of the broadcast approach to marketing and the emergence of a concept where a brand was being defined by multiple stakeholders. While at some level this has always been true, brand owners were more in control in the past. This has been driven by increased mobile penetration and rapid advancements in user interface design that have made it significantly easier to enrol new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, the changes became far more explosive due to the pandemic. With forced lockdowns and fears of the unknown, people clamoured for the comfort of others and found it in the digital world. Physical distances no longer mattered and interest-based communities bloomed; ones that might not have survived in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, as early as Jun 2020 before the full impact of the crisis, nearly 40% of online communities indicated that their growth had accelerated, 25% of those indicating a massive increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see this as a key change for how brands are built – by the community, for the community and in many cases, by the community. Massive democratization of the entire brand value creation process is in play and we seek to build capacity to align ourselves, our customers and the broader community to these changes. Which brings me to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;funnel-management&quot;&gt;Funnel Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In close alignment with democratization of brands, there is a need for organizations to redefine what was earlier known as the #ordertocash cycle. While tools existed in the past to get into granular metrics of the sales funnel, they lacked the scale to provide meaningful and statistically significant results for many organizations. As consumers were forced to adopt more digital means to order and pay for their everyday needs, digital tools got the scale they hitherto lacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of measuring leads and lags has come down significantly and measurement quality has increased dramatically. These metrics are now available real-time and are more definitive indicators of behaviour over intent-based data. For the &lt;a href=&quot;https://samriddhiconsulting.com/instructional_design/usher_in_the_era_of_agility&quot;&gt;agile&lt;/a&gt; organisation, this can unlock tremendous value and we hope to be a part of that journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-experience&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://samriddhiconsulting.com/user_experience/home&quot;&gt;User Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digitalisation has colossally impacted everyone in the value creation cycle – sales, marketing, operations, IT, supply chain, finance, human resources – all parts of a business. While we think of this very often from a customer interface point of view, it is cold reality that employees ought to make significant changes in the way they deliver value to customers. This becomes dramatically complicated when we think of the changes that may be required to make workplaces more accessible and intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should organizations create interfaces similar to actual physical experiences or should they make them unique to stay distinct? Should interfaces be simple and easy to navigate or should they replace humans who would essay a certain role? There are many such questions but no easy answers. We seek to partner and learn with organisations who want to solve these puzzles and make the workplace future-ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you’ve read till here, we have a small favour to ask you. While we are investing strengthen our capabilities, we know we cannot do it alone. Please help us to connect with other professionals and organisations in your network who have built solutions for these spaces. We’re excited by what these synergies could bring for our clients and indeed to the entire ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are seeking to engage with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UX Design specialists with an eye for minimalistic designs. While we are open to other approaches, we currently believe this is best expressed vide figma&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Front-End Development experts who are performance-oriented (technicalseo) developers, understand how Google Search works and can integrate complex solutions into light interfaces. We use a lot of Chrome Web-Tools including Lighthouse and Rich-Results.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Usher in the era of Agility</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the outset, a very happy New year to everyone. Never has it felt like such an achievement! The last year felt like a Ninja obstacle course, what with the ongoing pandemic, series of lockdowns and varied protests across the world. No doubt, we have all emerged better, stronger and more grateful on the other side but it’s now time to look ahead at what this new year could bring for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 has prepared us in a journey towards agility. Our response time and resilience in the face of crisis was tested in so many different ways last year. Almost every business had to think differently. In some situations, it was just important to turn up and engage with employees and customers. Even if the response was not optimised, our last-minute agility demanded that we reacted and adapted. Many of us felt the repercussions spill into our personal lives and interpersonal relationships too. 
Every day of the year, we were adapting to the situation, to the present. But now it’s about adapting to the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what the soothsayers say about 2021, there’s one thing we will all agree upon. This year will belong to the agile. To those who stay strong yet flexible. Those who demonstrate speed in evaluating the circumstances. To those who act with courage but care. To those of us who stay focused on the goal, rather than how we get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Oxford English Dictionary defines Agility as the “ability to move quickly and easily”, being agile is about having a growth mindset. &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.thoughtworks.com/articles/adaptive-leadership-accelerating-enterprise-agility-jim-highsmith-thoughtworks.pdf&quot;&gt;James Highsmith puts it best&lt;/a&gt; that being agile includes the ability to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage&lt;/strong&gt; by collaborating, communicating and inspiring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore&lt;/strong&gt; by becoming a great lifelong learner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolve Issues&lt;/strong&gt; while navigating ambiguity and paradox&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adapt&lt;/strong&gt; by being open to change and embracing the change process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agility cannot be built in the absence of information – particularly about the changes in the environment and hence engaging with the situation is a key first step. Decentralised systems and processes allow for faster and greater exploration. Breaking down silos and creating opportunities for frequent ideas sharing and knowledge transfer goes a long way in resolving issues and increasing agility. This helps in building an adaptive leader or a culture that quickly blends in the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, unless agility is part of the organisation’s deep-rooted culture, it will only take the next crisis to throw the ship off. Since 2000, ‘agile’ has increasingly been used as a management practice in project management and technology implementations. However few organisations took actionable measures to build an agile culture, develop agile leaders within and respond to their customers and changing markets with agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021 is the time to really build our muscle and put agility into action, in all aspects of our lives – personal and professional&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Universal Design for Learning - An Introduction</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The human mind in general and how it learns, in specific, has been a realm of fascination and delight for me, for many years now. We used to think that the whole subject of learning new things ends once we finish our formal education and enter the workplace. Of course, now we know that the truth couldn’t be further from there. Learning for life is a deeper reality than earlier considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, whether approaching formal academic education or professional learning, the truth about how our mind absorbs new information remains the same. More importantly, the challenges around those learning are also similar - the primary one amongst them being how to make learning accessible to everyone. When I think about the building blocks of learning, I start with accessibility. How will a person learn if the knowledge or skill being learnt is difficult to access?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img srcset=&quot;/assets/images/udlg_graphic_organiser_v2-2-post550.jpg 550w, /assets/images/udlg_graphic_organiser_v2-2-post750.jpg 750w /assets/images/udlg_graphic_organiser_v2-2-post.jpg 1200w&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/udlg_graphic_organiser_v2-2-post.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width:650px) 550w, 750w, 1200w&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid float-left&quot; alt=&quot;A child building a rocket ship with blocks&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 70vh; width: auto;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does accessibility mean in the context of learning design? This is one of the first questions I ask as an instructional designer. For me, the Universal Design for Learning or UDL has always provided a comprehensive yet simple framework to help answer this question. In this three-
part series on UDL, I hope to share some of the key features of UDL and how it has helped me in my journey as an instructional designer over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessibility as per UDL refers to an inclusive learning design that ensures that different types of learners engage with the content in multiple ways and find the motivation to apply it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UDL encompasses a range of principles to ensure that learning content motivates all types of learners, the content is represented in a variety of ways and the learner engagement is approached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my study as an instructional designer, when I first came across UDL, I was simply fascinated by the completeness of this structure. At first glance, it looked like an off-shoot of Kolb’s work on the different learning styles to me. However, it just took a scratch of reading to understand that learning styles are focused on ‘fixing the learner’ but UDL is focused on fixing the learning experience on the whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is what makes this body of work so intense and I’ve never stopped going back to it as my sine qua non. It takes a lot of research and deep analysis of learning and neuroscience to develop a model like UDL. It’s deceptively simple and is mostly used for academic learning design to ensure our classrooms are more inclusive to all types of learners. The possibilities of applying it into our professional learning experiences are however endless.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unconscious biases and the conundrums of parenting</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your children are not your children.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;footer class=&quot;blockquote-footer&quot;&gt;-	Kahlil Gibran&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are so many dimensions to a parent-child relationship, the events of the past few months have made me notice the times we – as parents – encourage unconscious biases amongst our children, even in the most innocent of conversations. I often wonder if parenting in the current times is harder or easier than a few generations ago. It felt easy because growing up, our parents would simply “tell” us what to do and we’d listen. They were after all the ultimate authority figures in our life, perhaps after our teachers. However, as we have grown, and realised that sometimes in our quest to continue finding authority figures in our lives – in managers, partners or even friends, we end up in toxic relationships, and with tons of biases!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercising ‘authority’ over our children is a very delicate balance to be maintained. A lot of us overcome it over the years, but it always leaves unconscious biases deep within. Parents try to protect their children and give a decision-making framework to work within. Don’t talk to someone dressed up like that or be careful if you’re going to a neighbourhood dominated by a particular group. However, involving children in the ‘process’ of decision making is more important than involving them in the outcome. The outcome is for them to see and in most cases execute, but the process remains hidden, and that’s where a large number of dilemmas are handled, habits are formed and references created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a parent now, I don’t know how to help my ten-year-old come to understand himself better, and be independent - physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. But I do know that ‘telling what to think’ is something I will stay away from. It’s a huge ask and it will conflict with my values sometimes. For example, a few days ago while watching a Netflix series, my son had a plethora of questions and opinions about homosexuals. Or when he reads about basic rights at school and asks about our domestic helps. I’ve been raised to ‘not think’ about these issues. To accept certain societal norms as facts but if I continue that tradition, I’m encouraging the legacy of biases and giving my son a limited mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents are great people, educated and well meaning. They gave us exposure and freedom, but they probably didn’t have the courage to rise over their personal circumstances and think about giving us principles that last the test of time and place. Principles that could be applied everywhere and would still hold true. Like cardinal truths, these are guiding lights. Because parents aren’t around all the time, their job is only to equip their children with guiding principles and a checklist that helps them take quick effective decisions in a variety of situations. The decisions may not be perfect, but it’ll help them get past whatever they are facing - bullying, relationships, careers, biases and so many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that doesn’t change whether I am an 18th century parent or raising a millennial. If I possess the courage and vulnerability to teach my child – not what to think and what opinions to form but how to think and how to discuss opinions, I have raised a human who can thrive in any era, in any culture. Then, when we get to corporate workplaces, we don’t have to be taught behaviours like “don’t judge” and “don’t be biased”. What a save from the unlearning and relearning to correct our frames of reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried to correct mine, but I still keep questioning them and re-calibrating them with what is happening around me. Feels like I’ve got a breakthrough – no matter how small, but remind me to keep doing a rain check every now and then!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bite-size your way to productivity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are some definite advantages to working from home and enough has been written about those since March 2020. Covid-19 however has added an unfortunate variable of ‘work at home’ to an endless quantum of work from home - thereby blurring boundaries and causing burnout. With schools and day cares schools, domestic help limited and restaurants closed, the entire conundrum of ‘how to be productive working at home’ suddenly fell upon us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of us are on the overworked end of the spectrum. We don’t know when to stop working, hopping from one task to another and one call to another, never getting a moment to rest. Some others though are on the overwhelmed end of the spectrum. Never knowing where to start from because between video calls, emails and presentations, they also have to squeeze in cooking, cleaning and parenting! Its daunting – especially for structure people like me, who created their next day’s to-do list before going to bed every night!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my friends are fortunately in the middle of this work-life balance spectrum. Speaking to them was very insightful and helped me uncover the concept of bite-sizing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a learning and development professional, I’m a huge fan of bite sized learning. So this was a natural progression for me. Breaking down something large and daunting into chewable chunks leads to greater effectiveness. And it appears that it’s as true for learning as it is for productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept is simple - if a task takes me one hour to complete, and I am unable to schedule a clear one hour in my day, due to interruptions at home, then I need to chunk it down. If I can squeeze in 15 minutes, I start the task. If I manage 20 minutes, that’s great. Or else I leave it at 15, and come back when I get my next 15 minutes window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know this may sound over simplistic, but once you practice it, you’ll be surprised at how powerful it is in breaking you out of a procrastination loop. Plus, for me personally this technique works wonders because most of my work involves thinking and chewing on those thoughts. The actual time I need to spend in front of a laptop is very less if my thoughts are well structured and deeply thought through. So you could find me deep me thought, folding laundry, or some other such mundane task!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does the bite-sizing technique help you fit in so much more during the day, the breaks actually help cut the monotony and give your body the much needed physical movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the next time your partner asks you to do the dishes, schedule it between your presentations and email marathons, and you may surprise yourself with the results!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>To New Beginnings</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-Yoda (Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having entered a new decade, I can’t help but look back at the decade gone by and wonder if there’s ever been such a game-changing ten-year run for HR professionals – what with HR automation, people analytics, gig economy, millennials and learning-on-the-go challenging every paradigm of people management for the better. HR is moving from processing paper to making individuals feel valued in the organisation and supporting their talent journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are exciting times to be working on people capability. Not only are the employees more aware about the possibilities and opportunities that exist to enable them, their managers are more receptive than ever. This has largely to do with the fact that learning or talent development has become more embedded into the employee’s role, rather than a stand-alone training program with little transferability into the learner’s job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is all the more exciting about building people capability in these times is the ecosystem we are working in – the community that wants to learn and become better than yesterday. Our peers who share knowledge and new learning as freely as they share their Instagram updates. The manager who spend their after-work hours learning a new tech-tool from a college grad. The HR management systems that are making way for Employee Experience Platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial Revolution 4.0 has indeed come knocking at our doors in style! I can’t wait to see how this unfolds in the 2020s and the endless possibilities it brings for us to leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Of cultures and new hires</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of talk about culture fit, when it comes to hiring for our teams. I’ve heard many managers using the phrase rather loosely when they can’t put a finger on the pulse. Now if you’ve ever tried asking these recruiting managers - what exactly is a culture fit for them – chances are they can’t always describe it to you in objective terms. It is indeed a tough ask because often it is a soft, fuzzy feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can culture fitment really be quantified then? Psychometric assessments and value-based tests have made us come closer to an answer. However, the moment of truth usually takes place in the interview – when the recruiting manager and the candidate are sitting face to face from each other. That fuzzy feeling is to be trusted, no matter what the psychometrics may say. The question is only if we can find a common language to describe it to other stakeholders, and possibly even the candidate (in an ideal world!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always felt that the key to finding the right words to express is often to step back and first check if it all adds up inside our heads. In this case too, before we try to find a common language, the first step is to break down the interview experience in our heads and write down the way you felt meeting the candidate. Did the person come across as genuine or was s/he putting too much effort into the process? Did the person think through enough before answering? Did his/her answers were consistent with everything else you’ve seen about the candidate in the interview process? Write down some of these pointers to look out for before the interview. You can lean on your earlier experience or even speak to some experienced interviewers in your company for inspiration. It helps to know what else you’re looking for, apart from the functional skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just taking our filters off and knowing how the interview felt for you is extremely useful to write down these ‘descriptors’. Once you have a list of these words, the next step is to sit with your HR or an experienced recruiter in your organisation who can help you bucket these words into your company’s culture framework. This is why many companies follow a best practice of having a two-member panel for every interview. It gives the interviewers someone to bounce off their thoughts, feelings and descriptors with, within the frame of the company’s culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say, accountability is something your organisation values in a new hire. You pick on all the large and small signs that add up to accountable behaviour. Did the person arrive in time, maybe called up in advance and checked for directions and parking arrangements? These small details not just show the interest one takes in the role, but also ownership. I’ve often experienced candidates who start talking about the company they are interviewing with, as ‘us’ – turn out to be very high on accountability when hired. Something else may work for you as an interviewer, and a hiring manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing in a new hire into your team is a major decision and taking into account all parameters – functional and otherwise – is a wise step. When you know what you’re looking for, you can even figure out in the interview if your near-perfect candidate can pick up on a small cultural nuance or not. That’s something that will be hard to interpret just by looking at a psychometric report or a test, and it could just be the difference between a good hire and a not-so-good one.&lt;/p&gt;
