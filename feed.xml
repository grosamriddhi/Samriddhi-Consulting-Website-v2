The more you read and deliberate over a particular subject, the more interesting it keeps getting. More branches keep emerging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something similar happened to me when I wrote my blog post on Naomi Osaka and vulnerability a few weeks back. One thing led to another, and I can’t stop thinking about how the constructs of vulnerability and trust intermingle at workplace – from leadership to now my latest muse, how does it manifest in the new normal remote workplace?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an independent consultant, I started working from home in late 2019 – much before the pandemic struck. Even before that, I was fortunate to have worked in a culture that encouraged flexibility and trusted me to deliver outcomes – not clock hours! So, when the lockdown first started, I heard several of my friends and associates share horror tales of being in front of the laptop camera for 9 hours, having to deliver daily reports of how they have used their day (some subtly but mostly not), keeping their teams busy with meaningless work because otherwise they don’t know how else to show productivity and worse – being micromanaged using time-sheet tools!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mixed emotions of gratitude for not being in their situation and despair for not being able to help, got me thinking about the reasons behind such behaviours. I also did a few webinars on working in the new normal, but frustratingly most of the questions by participants were around ‘monitoring’ employees. With time, employers and employees started accepting that this was how things were going to be, but every time there is a dip in the pandemic and the lockdown is eased, employees are called back into work. You’re probably nodding your head right now as you’re reading this, if you’re one of those back at work – all masked up and stocked with sanitisers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you’re a factory supervisor or a sales manager, I get it that your work requires you to be on field. However, if a corporate staff member is asked to work from office on a regular basis, I sense that there is a trust deficit in the organisational culture. Trust itself is a complex paradigm. Layer it up with the complexities of the pandemic and it becomes truly hard to comprehend. However, I am attempting to see trust in the new normal from the following three dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care&lt;/strong&gt;: The cornerstone of any relationship during these unprecedented times, I would place authentic and genuine care about your team members ahead of any other thought. The keyword being authentic, of course!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competence&lt;/strong&gt;: I would have normally put this first, but these are tough times. Even then, competence cannot be traded for any other trait at work. If an employee is struggling to deliver, to understand what is expected of her/ him, is unable to ask the right questions and seek help when needed, is finding it difficult to use the empowerment provided – then I would be reluctant to trust such a team member. This is especially true of a time when I cannot see where s/he is struggling and s/he isn’t able to articulate it well enough, even if I can take time out to coach the employee. Being remote puts the onus of development and competence building on the employee – and that’s an interesting topic for my next blog post hopefully😊&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication&lt;/strong&gt;: I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this dimension. From being extremely clear in the goals and expectations of an employee to establishing a cadence for check-ins and reviews to finally, providing constructive and timely feedback to the employee, communication is the spine that runs all along a remote work environment. Moreover, do you really think that in a virtual setting, our erstwhile communication principles of ‘70% efficacy comes from body language’ will still hold ground? Words have become so important – and hence it is critical we communicate clearly, with simple words and confirm that the other person has understood our message. Assuming that the person on the other side of the laptop screen has read your defensive body language or the sad eye expression is setting you up for major surprises!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot being written and discussed about how workplace relationships are changing in the new normal. Trust is just one building block of organisational culture that is undergoing major flux. Data security, organisational policies, and business models are some of the others. All of these inter-mingle and have a lot to do with how trust manifests in an organisation to define what shape its culture will take when the dust settles on this pandemic. Let’s hope it’s a shape that enables us all to bring our best to work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vidhi Kumar</name></author><category term="organisation_development" /><summary type="html">Has it ever happened to you that you start thinking about or reading a particular topic and then every discussion that you have leads up to the same topic?

For multiple reasons! On a personal note, for the first time, I was able to introduce my son - now eleven - to the glory of the world’s largest sporting event! Five years ago, he was too young to appreciate the grandeur of this event, all that goes into its planning (especially this unprecedented one), the training the athletes go through, the wide range of sporting events that it supports (BMX is his favourite by the way!!) and the diversity of nations that participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a sporting fan, as I’ve shared earlier. However, the beauty of these events is in what it teaches us beyond the sporting techniques. It warmed my heart to see Naomi Osaka light the Olympic flame, which passed through the deserving hands of so many young and old athletes, frontline workers, and school students. A perfect example of inclusion when we are planning any event as an organisation. I was immediately reminded of my first manager who would always insist that any HR intervention we plan must reach the last mile of the organisation and truly resonate with every member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sporting events were a delight to watch even for those of us who don’t follow the sport on a regular basis. We spent an entire Sunday afternoon watching archery qualifiers and cheered for Atanu Das and Deepika Kumari!! How did that event engage me so deeply, I wondered later? I zeroed it down to two factors. One, the sheer passion of the athletes was so infectious that it permeated through the screen and had me invested in their matches. I geekily identified the second factor though as an instructional design strategy. A bite-sized video explaining every sport that helped bring viewers like me up to speed. In a matter of 60 seconds, the fast-paced video showed us the rules, the tricks, and the skills to appreciate in the sport. Voila! It was the perfect &lt;a href=&quot;/instructional_design/jitl&quot;&gt;Just-in-Time Learning&lt;/a&gt; session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, how can any thoughts on Tokyo 2020 be complete without a reference to the seven medals that India won in the Olympics and the four we won in the less talked about Paralympics? These may seem like a minuscule number in front of the top countries on the tally chart, but this Olympics was not about just winning a medal for those athletes. It was about showing unprecedented levels of grit and resilience, about patience and hard work, about relentless practice without access to comparable facilities. These medals are about ‘despite’ rather than ‘because of’ and taking the first step in the direction of winning - initiating. Mirabai’s humble abode, Ravi Dahiya’s simple village, Neeraj Chopra’s spartan training grounds - all may pale in comparison to where the top Olympians come from. However, instead of feeling victimised, these athletes took control of their passion and charged through the barriers between their skill and their achievements, and the future belongs to those of us who have taken charge of ourselves. They recognised their talent, took responsibility for training themselves, and stayed engaged in this uphill road to the medal. Even the Indian women’s hockey team that missed the medal by a whisker, has many inspiring stories to share of how they began their journey to the semi-finals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last blog post, I referred to the fact that learning and development of an employee is no longer the onus of the organisation or HR. It is for the employee to take charge of her/ his development, or face redundancy in this rapidly changing economy. As the world of work around us changes in ways we have never imagined, we cannot afford to stick to the old ways and depend on others for our growth, wellbeing and success. This is the time when we need to take charge of what we want to learn, how we want to learn it and when. While workplaces have been significantly disrupted because of the pandemic, what has emerged from this disruption is also a freedom to delink work from time and geography. It has given room for every employee to curate individual learning journeys and roadmaps that will meet her/ his unique career aspirations and work to her/ his individual strengths and opportunities – just like our Olympians this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo 2020 has taught us a lot, but my biggest takeaway is the value of taking initiative and not depending on anyone else to train, to engage or to be gritty.

Rightly so, in fact. My last post on vulnerability asked tons of questions – those I don’t have answers to today and those which will only be answered as we grow as a society. But what Satya highlighted was the importance of understanding a subject we have answers to and is impacting us today - how vulnerability interlinks with trust at workplaces, and its various manifestations, especially in leader-follower relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me onto an exciting research spree on this vast topic. Up until last year, I had only studied the works of the brilliant Brene Brown, when it came to vulnerability and courage. I had read Paul Zak and how the neuroscience of Trust impacts workplace productivity. However, to understand how the two subjects mingle, I dug deeper into the studies by Jeff Polzer, Daniel Coyle, Roger Mayer, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A poignant research by Nienaber et al. in 2015 (Vulnerability and trust in Leader-Follower relationships) pointed out that “In the case of trust between leader and followers, both Mayer et al. (1995) and Rousseau et al. (1998) define trust as the follower’s willingness to be vulnerable based on positive expectations that his leader will not take advantage of this vulnerability.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s spare you the academic research for a moment (although if you’re a research bug like me, would love to share notes!!). I’ll, however, get to the point that intrigued me most, in all these studies - Vulnerability precedes Trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polzer’s classic Vulnerability Loop is a simple yet profound structure to explain this. I send you a signal of vulnerability. You detect it and respond with your signal of vulnerability, thereby establishing a norm in this relationship - which in turn builds trust. Think about all the relationships where there is deep trust - the vulnerability loop makes so much sense, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s where I’d throw a spanner - what happens when the other party - say, a leader - does not respond with vulnerability, or worse, takes advantage of your vulnerability? Would you still precede your trust with vulnerability? Would you take a leap of faith the next time you are faced with a similar situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure, most of us have been faced with such a situation in the past at our workplace, and our reactions would have been different. Some of us coil up in defence while others brush off the dust and take our position at the start of the vulnerability loop again! Some days we have the courage to face this lack of trust and other days, we just run out of steam. Some people, we find easier to start all over with, while with others, an irreparable breach of trust builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these responses are so natural and human, and none can be defined as right or wrong. However, if there’s one thing that I have learnt from all this research as well as my personal brushes with vulnerability, it is the importance of starting over with a fresh slate. The importance of keeping faith and not letting past breaches of trust impact our future relationships. One may think it may be easier for leaders than followers - but speak to the managers who have stood up for their teams, only to find them unwilling to reciprocate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leader-follower relationships, like any dyadic relationship, are complex and multi-layered. A trusting one takes time and concerted effort to build and nurture, but once established, it becomes valuable beyond measure. You just have to keep looking for the right one to invest in – and that requires you to keep picking yourself up and having the courage to ‘precede with vulnerability’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one can summarise this better than my favourite Brene Brown, so I’ll leave it to her:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p class=&quot;mb-0&quot;&gt;And when we make the choice to dare greatly, we sign up to get our asses kicked.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;mb-0&quot;&gt;We can choose courage or we can choose comfort, but we can’t have both.&lt;/p&gt;

I couldn’t get myself to…amidst the disturbing second wave of the pandemic in India. The losses of those so dear to me like my mentor and my best friend’s father felt too painful to recover from. But this post isn’t about the negativity, it’s about emerging from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the worst hopefully behind us, I took to reading some of the more positive pieces of news. The most striking one in recent days that encouraged me to write, was the uplifting news of Naomi Osaka. The 23-years old tennis superstar has shocked the sports world by announcing that she will withdraw from this year’s French Open. It all started when she announced that she wouldn’t participate in any post-game press conferences. According to this emotionally intelligent athlete, these press conferences only kicked down the loser, at a time when s/he was already at a low. That made so much sense to me… Refreshingly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the leaders of the world’s top tennis organisations pointed out to the Code of Conduct that she will be breaching by doing so, while in the same piece assuring that they were concerned about Osaka’s wellbeing. Unsurprisingly, the double standards were visible to more than just Osaka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News like this stands out in our faces not because they are rocking the world of tennis alone, but also because they show that a new era of role models is emerging. Is this really an unveiling of the responsible celebrities, who care as much for their mental health as for their physical fitness? More importantly, is a section of the next generation finally finding their deep-seated vulnerability and courage, to stand up for what feels right to them, rather than cow down to legal arm twisting or social pressures? Athletes from even a decade older would push their boundaries and hurt themselves to show their invincibilities. What it did to their mental and emotional well-being was a question never asked. Who wants to look soft and mushy on the court, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take it to the corporate and you will find the same parallels. No one wants to look emotionally vulnerable in a job, let alone talk about it. We continue to drag on our steely persona, to a point that we sometimes forget the inner voice that’s asking for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Osaka’s news comes as huge learning in emotional intelligence, vulnerability and courage for leaders today. As employees grapple with so much at a personal level, can we give them room to bring their vulnerable selves to work? Can we accept them when they say, “I’m not okay to do this right now” or, “I think I need to step back and take care of my mental well-being”? How do leaders role model this behaviour - by putting up their steely front or by accepting that they are not beyond shock and loss? How do corporate cultures support those who bring up their needs for mental help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability is the cornerstone of a brave and kind corporate culture, one that allows people to fight their battles, but also empathise when they can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes courage to build such a culture - and Osaka’s news had given me hope that as the world of sports evolves to make way for a new form of strength, the corporate leaders will also explore the place of vulnerability and empathy in their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vidhi Kumar</name></author><category term="organisation_development" /><summary type="html">I am writing after an extraordinarily long time.

If that’s interested you so far, you will certainly find this last post helpful in a more practical and hands-on way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by asking this – what’s the first thing you would do if you had to design a training program around a given set of training needs? Most training and development professionals I meet start by opening their MS PowerPoint or equivalent tool. What follows then is a traditional course requiring students to attend the ILT/ v-ILT, read specific texts, and then take a quiz or assessment at the end of the course to demonstrate their understanding. The outcome of such a program is content that leans more towards the style of the course creator, rather than being universal in its access and approach, like we discussed in the first blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you start applying UDL? I start by addressing the three key components of UDL in the course design by asking –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Affective Network: Can I engage my students in active learning and encourage them to see the value in content knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognition Network: Can I offer a variety of materials or paths in order to learn content to achieve each outcome?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategic Network: Can I offer multiple means of representation and expression for each learning outcome?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps me plot the different options I can design for recruiting and maintaining interest in the course, organising and learning new knowledge or skill, and communicating or expressing that acquired skill. Some of you may rightly find this similar to Bloom’s Taxonomy. Indeed, the questions asked at varying levels of complexity makes it possible to include the greatest number of students, and also helps to make the subject matter more engaging for everyone. In fact, Bloom’s Taxonomy compliments the principles of Universal Design for Learning because it allows students to learn about the same content at varying levels of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now having answered the above three questions, what are some of these design options or strategies you can use for ensuring each of the UDL principles of engagement, representation and motivation? Here are some of my favourite actionable steps that I take to target each of the three networks while designing an inclusive program:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Addressing the Affective network or the ‘why’ of learning
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Share clear outcomes or learning goals at the start of the course&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Provide adequate resources like pre-reads to prime the learners&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Support learning with stimulating activities&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Build a collaborative community to support learners, including discussion forums, Q&amp;amp;A board&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Encourage a safe learning culture&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Addressing the Recognition network or the ‘what’ of learning
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Understand and call out learner differences during the design phase&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Clarify the terminology used; perhaps include a glossary, especially for technical trainings&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Maximise use of scaffolding techniques when introducing new skill&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Illustrate the learning content using a variety of media&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Addressing the Strategic network or the ‘how’ of learning
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Reach the learner through a variety of mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Build in a rhythm around the learning process (for eg. goal setting, monitoring, reflection)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Provide a variety of learning tools like journals, videos, podcasts&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Give ample practice opportunities to support fluency of skills&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Monitor application of skills&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are of course just a set of techniques that have held me in good stead while designing accessible and inclusive learning content. Feel free to apply these in your own context. Hope you enjoyed this blog post series.

Ronald Mace, an American architect and product designer, coined the term Universal Design – as a means to promote the design of products and spaces that would be accessible to all people, and still meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This early version permitted a lot of flexibility to users and designers alike, and soon started to appeal to designers of classroom and other educational facilities where physical access was important. Although this helped schools include students with disabilities in a classroom, it still left a lacuna when it came to access to curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was addressed when in 1984, the Centre for Applied Special Technology or CAST was founded. Their work in developing innovative, technology-based educational resources and strategies created a need for making learning design accessible. Building on the existing work in Universal Design, CAST teamed up with developmental psychologist Lev Vygotsky who was studying the prerequisites for learning. Together they identified the three brain networks that today form the core of Universal Design for Learning or UDL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Affective network: engagement with the learning task.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognition network: recognition of the information to be learned.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategic network: application of strategies to process information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Universal Design principles of education have become the mainstay of some of the best educator training programs – encouraging educators how to ensure that their curriculum and learning strategies are designed to accommodate for individual differences in their learners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of UDL demonstrates the seamless cross pollination of ideas – educators drawing inspiration from architects and product designers, building on ideas to create something so succinct and profound. It – to me – is hope that this chain of symbiotic growth can continue from educators to corporate L&amp;amp;D professionals. Looking at their learners from a lens of andragogy instead of pedagogy, instructional designers can apply UDL principles to include a wider diversity in their classrooms or v-ILT sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With corporate learners seeking on-demand professional development, it will become increasingly rare to see homogenous classrooms – training sessions organised by a single organisation for a single type of audience, on a single topic. Imagine a subject like change management, which was earlier a highly rated strategy lesson – now has become relevant to every employee. Designing a curriculum that appeals to a fresh college graduate, a mid-level manager or a CEO, creating it such that the activities resound with their individual context and presenting the course keeping their demographic sensitivities in mind – these are not ‘good-to-do’s’ for an instructional designer anymore. They are very shortly going to become must-dos. Embracing the UDL framework will help us achieve inclusion of learning design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next and the last part of these blog post series dedicated to UDL, I will be sharing some of the ways we can use UDL guidelines in our context and some universal design for learning examples of my favourites!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vidhi Kumar</name></author><category term="Instructional_Design" /><summary type="html">With its roots deep into accessibility, I found it hardly surprising that the origins of Universal Design were in architecture.

These are mental shortcuts (known as heuristics), that help us make sense of the vast information around us​. Without them, we will be crippled when it comes to fast decision making and survival.​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-theres-nothing-wrong-with-having-unconscious-bias-right-&quot;&gt;So there’s nothing wrong with having unconscious bias, right? ​&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not entirely!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;​Unconscious bias is great for survival and ‘fast’ decision making, as Daniel Kahneman would put it - System 1 Thinking (Thinking, Fast and Slow – 2013)​.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, ‘slow’ and deliberate thinking (System 2 Thinking) requires us to remove these filters​&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good news is – it’s possible to work-around these biases once you are aware how to spot them. Let’s look at the top 10 biases that can cloud your decision making at a workplace and how to work around them.​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-types-of-cognitive-bias&quot;&gt;10 Types of Cognitive Bias:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Likeability Bias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affinity Bias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attribution Bias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirmation Bias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Halo (or Horns) Effect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proximity Bias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bandwagon Bias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loss Aversion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anchoring Bias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Availability Heuristic&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;Rooted in how we expect people of certain groups to behave, this bias leads us to liking people who behave as per these expectations. For example, men are liked when they are assertive, women when they are gentle and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

It brings people from different corners of the world together. Perhaps more importantly, it helps me filter the truly keen learners from those who have been mandated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our certified diversity facilitator workshop on March 2nd was another testimony to my belief. All of us were there in that frame because we truly believed in the cause of inclusion. The discussions in the breakout rooms were evidence of how engaged a virtual setup can get because as a participant I am getting views from such a diverse audience about D&amp;amp;I. We all stayed till the end because we really wanted to reflect on what insights Shruthi Gokuldas - our fireside chat guest - had to bring in. Rarely do you come across a leader who is willing to use her stories and vulnerabilities to drive home important learnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of the format further lent itself to deeper engagement. By sharing the pre-read on Cognitive Bias in advance, we had already primed the minds of our participants towards the session content. Such a format is powerful because it puts control into the learners’ hands. It required us to reach out to our participants in advance, through multiple channels but it was well worth it. They have the choice to read the content when they are in the best state to absorb that learning, leaving their minds free to absorb more during the actual session. The neuroscience of learning teaches us a thing or two about transferring pre-reads from our short-term memory to long-term memory! Critical content (in this case, the primer on Cognitive Bias because it forms the foundation of understanding diversity) should not only be shared in advance but also allowed to sit in the learners’ minds for at least one sleep cycle, thereafter reinforcing it (in our case, with a quickfire quiz!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got really ambitious in our breakout room activity and I want to thank every single one of our participants for engaging so deeply with the intense content. Breakouts lend themselves to open and candid discussions, diverse thoughts and clearer convergence because they allow people to work in small comfortable groups, where everyone has a voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s technology of course which I love! Virtual collaboration boards have replaced coloured post-it notes so efficiently. I never anyway liked the struggle of keeping the post-its stuck to the whiteboard whilst you debrief your activity! Besides, use the right tools, and you can keep the responses anonymous thereby creating a safe, open space for everyone to come forward and share ideas if you so plan in your activity. This is especially important for a topic like diversity and inclusion, where we struggle with our deep-rooted unconscious biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our certified diversity facilitator workshop has been a journey well begun… A journey that has brought together people who believe in a strong cause of inclusion and making a difference through diversity. This is exactly the reason why we brought on-board Sumana Dutta from the Akshadhaa Foundation as our inclusion partner. Her tireless efforts on ensuring how people of different abilities can be integrated into the mainstream of organisations are critical to our context today and resonate deeply with us at Samriddhi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, diversity is not a once in a year reminder on a special day. It is not an elitist cause to support. It is a belief, a future that we believe is sustainable because it makes business sense. And I am today proud to have taken a small step to create this community.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vidhi Kumar</name></author><category term="Instructional_Design" /><summary type="html">This is exactly why I’m a fan of virtual facilitations!

For us, diversity is not a once in a year reminder on a special day. It is not an elitist cause to support. It is a belief, a future that we believe is sustainable because it makes business sense. And I am today proud to have taken a small step to create this community.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/assets/images/iwd_event-post.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/assets/images/iwd_event-post.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Making Virtual Performance Management count</title><link href="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/organisation_development/making_virtual_performance_management_count" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Making Virtual Performance Management count" /><published>2021-02-14T10:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-02-14T10:30:00+05:30</updated><id>https://samriddhiconsulting.com/organisation_development/making_virtual_performance_management_count</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://samriddhiconsulting.com/organisation_development/making_virtual_performance_management_count">&lt;p&gt;It’s that time of the year again. We are scheduling reviews, blocking one-on-ones with direct reports and managers, and going over our performance records (even photos of that virtual game show you hosted to showcase your team management skills!). Like every year, performance management time brings a certain whiff in the air – part excitement, part trepidation and definitely a lot of time pressure. 
But that was every year and 2020 has not been like ‘every’ year! 
Just like the other aspects of people management, performance appraisals are also impacted this year. With most of the workforce working remotely for a large part of the year and many targets getting impacted, companies are rethinking their performance metrics closely. Not only are organisations reconsidering the year-gone-by, they are also reviewing how new targets should be set up. 
One could see an opportunity in this adversity. Many organisations are evaluating a move from their traditional annual performance appraisal cycle to the continuous performance cycle or an OKR-based (Objective and Key Results) approach. This was something that so many of us were mulling over for years but never found the right nudge. 2020 seems to have given everyone the right reasons to shed the traditional performance approach and move in favour of more progressive ones. 
There’s no doubt that this year’s performance exercise will be unlike anyone in the past. While there are several differences, we have put together this go-to guide to help us tide over one unique aspect of this year’s exercise – remote appraisals! For many managers, this could be the first time that their employees are not face-to-face with them during the appraisal. This guide is to help them prepare better and ensure they make the best of the appraisal session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1---choose-an-appropriate-environment&quot;&gt;1.   Choose an appropriate environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distractions are a reality in the virtual meeting, and so are technological ‘glitches’. Being prepared for both is important. Don’t keep a meeting immediately before or after your one-on-one with a team member. Encourage the team member to do the same. Work out a time when both of you are most productive to avoid virtual fatigue. Also align times with other people at home – perhaps a time when your internet bandwidth will be used least! 
The review should definitely be a video-based session otherwise it will slip into a monologue of one person talking, and the other listening with their audio and video switched off! 
And just like you would keep your review documents ready in a physical feedback session, keep everything handy for screen share in this case. If your organisation’s people practices allow, it might even be a good idea to share the doc ahead of the meeting, so your team members can go through it with less anxiety and jot down their thoughts or doubts. This way you can focus the meeting on actionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2---be-realistic&quot;&gt;2.   Be realistic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 was tough for everyone – some more than others. Have you taken a good assessment of how targets changed during the year for your team members? If you had already called this out sometime during the year, great! If not, this may be a good time to have a detailed discussion around what comprises of realistic goals. Use these one-on-one’s to read the pulse on your team members better and build confidence that their performance is being fairly evaluated in the light of the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, look at the team members who have gone over and above their work. Did they adapt their styles to meet the goals? Did they take extra initiative in another area? Did they do something that was not there on their original KRA sheet? Discuss with your HR beforehand, what your approach is to handle these outliers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-coach-more-listen-more&quot;&gt;3.	Coach more, listen more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic performance feedback session is a discussion where the managers and employee speak about KRAs one by one, listen to manager feedback and close with ratings. This year calls for more. More listening. More understanding. More empathy. Your team members have gone through a lot to achieve what they have. Give them the platform to share their stories – struggle or valour as it may be! 
Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is a great tool to coach your team members in this situation, instead of just giving a direct feedback. AI is a strengths-based model that seeks to engage your audience in self-determined change. Because it focuses on the positive and encourages change from within, the results are far more sustaining that any other feedback model and that’s the reason we at Samriddhi also love using this tool a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-think-out-of-the-box&quot;&gt;4.	Think out of the box&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use your creativity this performance appraisal. Think of new metrics that may be more relevant in a virtual work setup, for e.g. response time could be an easy metric to find. Review notes from your slack or teams’ channels or zoom recordings. This could also be the time to really start implementing a competency framework if you don’t already. It takes all subjectivity out of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now more than ever, a performance appraisal must be evidence-based and competency-focused. As we continue to be less visible, any rating of performance must be well-thought through and backed-up with examples of behaviors. Consider making 2021 goals short, objective and adaptive. Also, consider increasing the frequency of your performance discussions.
Here’s wishing everyone a highly productive appraisal season in this new normal!&lt;/p&gt;

With so much turbulence, we decided to focus our GTM efforts in managing our Instructional Design practice, to weather the storm. As the skies cleared, it became immediately apparent that we had to zoom into our GTM practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have officially and audaciously split our GTM work into three key areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;communitymanagement,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;funnelmanagement, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;userexperience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;community-management&quot;&gt;Community Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with my experience around the Maggi crisis, I saw first-hand, a failure of the broadcast approach to marketing and the emergence of a concept where a brand was being defined by multiple stakeholders. While at some level this has always been true, brand owners were more in control in the past. This has been driven by increased mobile penetration and rapid advancements in user interface design that have made it significantly easier to enrol new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, the changes became far more explosive due to the pandemic. With forced lockdowns and fears of the unknown, people clamoured for the comfort of others and found it in the digital world. Physical distances no longer mattered and interest-based communities bloomed; ones that might not have survived in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, as early as Jun 2020 before the full impact of the crisis, nearly 40% of online communities indicated that their growth had accelerated, 25% of those indicating a massive increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see this as a key change for how brands are built – by the community, for the community and in many cases, by the community. Massive democratization of the entire brand value creation process is in play and we seek to build capacity to align ourselves, our customers and the broader community to these changes. Which brings me to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;funnel-management&quot;&gt;Funnel Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In close alignment with democratization of brands, there is a need for organizations to redefine what was earlier known as the #ordertocash cycle. While tools existed in the past to get into granular metrics of the sales funnel, they lacked the scale to provide meaningful and statistically significant results for many organizations. As consumers were forced to adopt more digital means to order and pay for their everyday needs, digital tools got the scale they hitherto lacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of measuring leads and lags has come down significantly and measurement quality has increased dramatically. These metrics are now available real-time and are more definitive indicators of behaviour over intent-based data. For the &lt;a href=&quot;https://samriddhiconsulting.com/instructional_design/usher_in_the_era_of_agility&quot;&gt;agile&lt;/a&gt; organisation, this can unlock tremendous value and we hope to be a part of that journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-experience&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://samriddhiconsulting.com/user_experience/home&quot;&gt;User Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digitalisation has colossally impacted everyone in the value creation cycle – sales, marketing, operations, IT, supply chain, finance, human resources – all parts of a business. While we think of this very often from a customer interface point of view, it is cold reality that employees ought to make significant changes in the way they deliver value to customers. This becomes dramatically complicated when we think of the changes that may be required to make workplaces more accessible and intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should organizations create interfaces similar to actual physical experiences or should they make them unique to stay distinct? Should interfaces be simple and easy to navigate or should they replace humans who would essay a certain role? There are many such questions but no easy answers. We seek to partner and learn with organisations who want to solve these puzzles and make the workplace future-ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you’ve read till here, we have a small favour to ask you. While we are investing strengthen our capabilities, we know we cannot do it alone. Please help us to connect with other professionals and organisations in your network who have built solutions for these spaces. We’re excited by what these synergies could bring for our clients and indeed to the entire ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are seeking to engage with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UX Design specialists with an eye for minimalistic designs. While we are open to other approaches, we currently believe this is best expressed vide figma&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Front-End Development experts who are performance-oriented (technicalseo) developers, understand how Google Search works and can integrate complex solutions into light interfaces. We use a lot of Chrome Web-Tools including Lighthouse and Rich-Results.&lt;/p&gt;
